Some problems are difficult if solved with just an algorithm and should instead be solved with a class. So the idea is not constructing a data structure but a class that may be a data structure that will allow us to solve the problem well. \n",

    "Not every question is purely algorithm-focused, as we've seen, some are just coding where we manipulate pointers. Questions regarding these cases are focused on the data structure or class that we need to construct, and the algorithm wouldn't be too complicated to finish the solution."

    "Say you have a sorted array of integers, and you want to find an integer. You look at the middle of the array and check if that integer is the one you are looking for. If it is great! If not, if it is greater than the integer you are looking for, you know that your integer lies in the section of the array before that integer. Similarly, if that integer is less than the integer you are looking for, you know that it lies in the section of the array after. You repeat this process until you find the integer you are looking for.\n",
